  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      This formula installs the `hush` CLI only.

      The `hushd` daemon is experimental and is not installed by default.
      If you want to try it anyway, build it from source:

        cargo install --path crates/services/hushd
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "hush #{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/hush --version")

    # Test basic help
    assert_match "security verification", shell_output("#{bin}/hush --help")
  end
end
