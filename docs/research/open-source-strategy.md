## 1. The Category: Swarm Detection & Response

### 1.1 Why a New Category

In 2013, CrowdStrike defined **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** by putting an agent on every endpoint that could detect and respond to threats in real time. The "endpoints" of 2013 were laptops and servers. The "endpoints" of 2026 are **AI agents**.

The AI agent market is growing at 40-46% CAGR, projected to reach $52-139 billion by 2030-2034. Gartner estimates 40% of enterprise applications will embed task-specific agents by the end of 2026. Yet the security story for these agents is catastrophically behind deployment velocity:

- **63% of organizations** have no limits on what AI agents are authorized to do
- **60% of organizations** cannot terminate AI agents quickly
- **Zero mainstream products** provide runtime enforcement at the AI agent tool boundary
- **Zero products** provide cryptographic proof of what an AI agent did at runtime
- In November 2025, Anthropic detected the first documented AI-orchestrated espionage campaign: **autonomous agents working as a coordinated swarm** targeting 30 organizations simultaneously

Traditional EDR cannot address this threat. EDR watches endpoints for malware signatures and behavioral anomalies. AI agents are not malware -- they are authorized code with authorized access that can be manipulated via prompt injection, jailbreaking, tool abuse, and lateral data exfiltration. The attack surface is the **tool boundary**, not the binary. The threat unit is the **swarm**, not the individual process.

**Swarm Detection & Response (SDR)** is the security category that addresses this gap. SDR provides:

1. **Runtime enforcement at the agent tool boundary** -- every file access, network request, MCP tool invocation, and code patch is policy-gated
2. **Kernel-level execution proofs** -- not just what was deployed, but what actually executed, verified by eBPF at the Linux kernel level
3. **Cryptographic attestation** -- every guard decision produces an Ed25519-signed receipt recorded in an append-only Merkle tree transparency log
4. **Cross-layer proof chains** -- a single verification request returns evidence spanning kernel syscalls, network flows, workload identity, and agent-level guard decisions
5. **Swarm-aware detection** -- correlation of agent process trees to MITRE ATT&CK kill chains, with awareness of multi-agent coordination patterns
6. **Decentralized policy marketplace** -- community-curated security policies with multi-curator attestation, not single-vendor controlled detection logic
7. **Offline-capable mesh enforcement** -- via the Reticulum transport profile, security facts propagate even over LoRa, packet radio, and intermittent connectivity

### 1.2 The CrowdStrike Analogy

| Dimension | CrowdStrike (EDR, 2013) | ClawdStrike (SDR, 2026) |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Protected entity** | Endpoints (laptops, servers) | AI agents (Claude, GPT, Codex, custom) |
| **Agent placement** | Kernel sensor on every endpoint | Guards at every agent tool boundary |
| **Detection method** | Behavioral analysis + IOC matching | 7 built-in guards + kernel eBPF + ML/LLM judge |
| **Enforcement** | Process kill, network quarantine | Tool boundary deny, kernel Sigkill, network policy drop |
| **Evidence** | Mutable event logs | Append-only Merkle tree with witness co-signatures |
| **Policy source** | CrowdStrike threat intel (proprietary) | Community marketplace (multi-curator, signed, IPFS) |
| **Deployment** | Agent per endpoint + cloud console | SDK per agent runtime + hushd daemon + desktop console |
| **Trust model** | Trust CrowdStrike completely | Configurable trust roots, offline verification, no vendor lock |

### 1.3 Market Validation

The market is signaling readiness for this category:

- **Cloud Security Alliance** published the "Agentic Trust Framework" (Feb 2026) outlining zero-trust governance for AI agents -- which ClawdStrike's architecture directly implements
- **AccuKnox** published "Top 5 ADR Security Solutions" (2026), recognizing Agent Detection & Response as an emerging space
- **Operant AI** launched "Agent Protector" (Feb 2026) to secure autonomous agents at scale -- validating market demand
- **Harvard Business Review / Palo Alto Networks** published "6 Cybersecurity Predictions for the AI Economy" predicting a new category of AI governance tools providing runtime enforcement
- **Gravitee** published "State of AI Agent Security 2026" reporting that adoption has outpaced control across enterprises
- The **EU AI Act** (full implementation 2027) will require exactly the kind of runtime transparency and auditability that ClawdStrike provides

The governance gap is widening. Deployment velocity is accelerating. No incumbent has the architecture to address AI agent swarm security. The category is open.

## 2. Unified Project Structure

### 2.1 Target Monorepo

The consolidation merges four currently separate codebases and projects into one cohesive repository:

## 3. Migration Plan

### 3.1 What Moves From Where

**From `standalone/aegis/` (AegisNet services):**

| AegisNet Component | Target | Notes |
|-------------------|--------|-------|
| `services/aegisnet/checkpointer/` | `spine/nats/checkpointer/` | Core Merkle tree builder, checkpoint emitter |
| `services/aegisnet/witness/` | `spine/nats/witness/` | Independent co-signer |
| `services/aegisnet/proofs-api/` | `spine/nats/proofs-api/` | HTTP endpoints for inclusion proofs |
| `services/aegisnet/observability/` | Split: metrics to `spine/metrics/`, dashboards to `desktop/` | Prometheus alerts stay in `infra/deploy/` |
| `services/aegisnet/model-registry/` | Stays in Aegis | Not security-specific |
| `services/aegisnet/smoketest*` | `spine/nats/tests/` | Integration tests |
| `crates/aegisnet/` | `spine/src/` | Core Spine protocol types |
| `crates/cyntra-trust/` | `core/trust/` | Attestation/trust primitives |

**From `platform/docs/specs/` (Reticulum + Spine specs):**

| Spec | Target | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `cyntra-aegis-spine-reticulum.md` | `docs/src/integrations/transports/reticulum.md` | Transport profile spec |
| `cyntra-aegis-spine.md` | `docs/src/spine/protocol.md` | Core Spine protocol spec |
| `cyntra-aegis-net-design-axioms.md` | `docs/src/architecture/design-axioms.md` | Design invariants |
| `cyntra-aegis-trust-infrastructure.md` | `docs/src/architecture/trust-infrastructure.md` | Trust model |

**From `standalone/clawdstrike/` (current repo -- restructure in place):**

| Current | Target | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `crates/libs/hush-core` | `core/` | Rename crate directory |
| `crates/libs/clawdstrike` | `guards/` | Rename crate directory |
| `crates/services/hushd` | `daemon/` | Rename crate directory |
| `crates/services/hush-cli` | `cli/` | Rename crate directory |
| `crates/libs/hush-wasm` | `sdk/wasm/` | Move to SDK directory |
| `packages/sdk/hush-ts` | `sdk/typescript/` | Move to SDK directory |
| `packages/sdk/hush-py` | `sdk/python/` | Move to SDK directory |
| `apps/desktop` | `desktop/` | Move to top level |

**What stays in `platform/infra/` (Kubernetes infrastructure):**

- ArgoCD Application manifests (`cilium.yaml`, `tetragon.yaml`, `aegisnet-*.yaml`, `spire.yaml`)
- Terraform modules for EKS, VPC, IAM
- Karpenter NodePool/EC2NodeClass definitions
- Docker Compose for local development services
- These are deployment-specific and do not belong in the OSS repo

### 3.2 Migration Sequence

```
Phase 1: Restructure ClawdStrike repo (rename crates/ → top-level dirs)
    │     This is a local refactor with no external dependencies.
    │     All existing functionality preserved.
    │
Phase 2: Copy AegisNet service code into spine/
    │     The AegisNet K8s deployments continue pointing at the aegis repo
    │     until Phase 4. The spine/ code is a parallel copy for development.
    │
Phase 3: Implement bridges/ (tetragon-nats-bridge, hubble-flow-bridge)
    │     New code. No migration needed.
    │
Phase 4: Deploy spine/ services alongside existing AegisNet
    │     Blue-green deploy: new Helm chart in infra/deploy/, ArgoCD switches over.
    │     Verify checkpointing, witnessing, proofs all work from ClawdStrike repo.
    │
Phase 5: Deprecate standalone aegis/services/aegisnet/
    │     Redirect ARCHITECTURE.md to clawdstrike docs.
    │     The aegis repo retains agents-api, bff, and web surface only.
    │
Phase 6: Public release
         GitHub public repo, documentation site, npm/crates.io packages.
```

### 3.3 Dependency Considerations

The consolidated repo's Rust workspace dependencies (from the current `Cargo.toml`) are already well-suited for open source:

- **Crypto**: `ed25519-dalek`, `sha2`, `sha3` (pure Rust, no vendored C)
- **Serialization**: `serde`, `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`
- **Async**: `tokio`, `async-trait`
- **HTTP**: `axum`, `tower`, `reqwest` (with `rustls`, not OpenSSL)
- **Database**: `rusqlite` (bundled SQLite)
- **Config**: `toml`, `dirs`

One concern: `openssl = { version = "0.10", features = ["vendored"] }` should be audited. If only used for TLS in specific adapters, it can be feature-gated or replaced with `rustls` throughout. For an open source release, minimizing vendored C dependencies reduces build friction.

---

## 4. Open Source Strategy

### 4.1 License Choice

**Recommendation: Apache 2.0**

The current `Cargo.toml` specifies `license = "MIT"`. For the consolidated public release, we recommend switching to **Apache 2.0** for these reasons:

| Factor | MIT | Apache 2.0 |
|--------|-----|------------|
| **Patent protection** | Silent on patents | Explicit patent grant + termination clause |
| **Enterprise adoption** | Good | Excellent (patent clarity removes legal friction) |
| **CNCF alignment** | Accepted | Preferred (Cilium, Tetragon, Falco all use Apache 2.0) |
| **Contributor clarity** | Ambiguous patent rights | Clear patent grant from contributors |
| **Competitive moat** | None | Patent termination clause discourages patent trolling |
| **Market data** | #1 by pageviews (2025) | #2 and growing, dominant in infrastructure/security |

Apache 2.0 is the standard for CNCF cloud-native security projects. Using it signals professionalism and aligns ClawdStrike with the ecosystem it integrates with (Cilium, Tetragon, SPIRE, NATS). The explicit patent grant removes a common enterprise adoption blocker.

The TypeScript/Python SDKs and adapters can remain MIT for maximum flexibility if desired, since they are thin wrappers. The core Rust crates, Spine protocol, bridges, and marketplace should be Apache 2.0.

### 4.2 Repository Structure

**Monorepo with Cargo workspace + npm workspaces:**

- All Rust crates in a single `Cargo.toml` workspace (as today)
- All TypeScript packages in npm workspaces
- Python packages managed via `pyproject.toml` with uv/pip
- Single CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) testing all languages
- Releases coordinated: Rust crates published to crates.io, TS packages to npm, Python to PyPI

**Why monorepo:**
- Atomic cross-crate refactors (Spine protocol changes affect guards, bridges, marketplace simultaneously)
- Single CI pipeline ensures compatibility
- Easier contributor onboarding (one repo to clone, one README)
- Matches successful precedent: Cilium monorepo, Sigstore monorepo

### 4.3 Community Governance Model

**Phase 1 (0-12 months): BDFL with Maintainer Council**

- Founding team retains final decision authority (BDFL = Benevolent Dictator For Life)
- Maintainer Council of 3-5 core contributors with commit access
- All design decisions documented in RFCs (markdown in `docs/rfcs/`)
- Weekly community call (recorded, notes published)
- Decision process: RFC -> community comment period (2 weeks) -> BDFL approval

**Phase 2 (12-24 months): Steering Committee**

As the contributor base grows beyond the founding team:
- Transition to 5-member elected Steering Committee
- BDFL retains veto on security-critical decisions only
- Sub-teams form around components: Guards, Spine, Desktop, Bridges, Marketplace
- Each sub-team has a lead with merge authority for their area
- Steering Committee resolves cross-cutting decisions

**Phase 3 (24+ months): CNCF Sandbox Application**

- Apply to CNCF Sandbox (requirements: 2+ maintainers from different orgs, Apache 2.0 license, CLA or DCO)
- Adopt CNCF governance template
- Dual-company maintainership (recruit maintainers from adopting companies)
- Path to CNCF Incubation requires: production adoption by 3+ organizations, security audit

This governance evolution mirrors successful projects like containerd (BDFL -> neutral governance on CNCF joining).

### 4.4 Contribution Guidelines

**Extension points (easiest contributions):**

1. **Rulesets** (`rulesets/community/`) -- YAML security policies. Lowest barrier to entry. Validated by schema, tested by CI. This is the on-ramp for security practitioners who are not Rust developers.

2. **Guard plugins** -- Implement the `Guard` trait (sync) or `AsyncGuard` trait (async) in Rust. Well-defined interface. Examples provided. New guards are the primary feature contribution path.

3. **Transport adapters** (`spine/`) -- New Spine transport planes. The Reticulum adapter is the template. MQTT, ZeroMQ, or custom transports can be added without modifying the core protocol.

4. **Framework adapters** (`adapters/`) -- TypeScript/Python adapters for new agent frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph). Thin wrappers that integrate the SDK with framework-specific hooks.

5. **Compliance templates** (`certification/`) -- SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, EU AI Act, FedRAMP templates mapping ClawdStrike capabilities to regulatory requirements.

6. **Bridge plugins** (`bridges/`) -- New kernel-level event sources (beyond Tetragon and Hubble). Falco, Sysdig, or custom eBPF programs can be bridged to the Spine.

**Contribution process:**
- All contributions via GitHub Pull Request
- DCO sign-off required (Developer Certificate of Origin, `Signed-off-by:` trailer)
- CI must pass: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`
- Security-sensitive changes require review from 2 maintainers
- Guard and ruleset contributions require test coverage

### 5.3 Revenue Model Analysis

**Comparable companies (security open core):**

| Company | Model | OSS License | ARR (2025) | How They Make Money |
|---------|-------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Wiz** | Cloud-native security SaaS | Proprietary | ~$700M+ (targeting $1B) | Agentless cloud scanning, CNAPP |
| **Snyk** | Developer security SaaS | Freemium + OSS scanners | ~$343M | SCA, SAST, container scanning |
| **Elastic** | Open core + cloud | SSPL / Apache 2.0 | ~$1.3B | Elastic Cloud managed service |
| **HashiCorp** | Open core + cloud | BSL / MPL 2.0 | ~$614M | HCP managed Terraform/Vault/Consul |
| **Sysdig** | Open core + cloud | Apache 2.0 (Falco) | ~$250M+ | Sysdig Secure SaaS |
| **CrowdStrike** | SaaS + agent | Proprietary | ~$3.7B | Falcon platform subscription |

**Key insight**: The most successful model for infrastructure security is **fully open source core + managed SaaS**. Elastic proved that SSPL/proprietary conversion destroys community trust. Sysdig proved that keeping Falco fully open while selling managed services works. HashiCorp's BSL switch was controversial. The market rewards genuine openness.

ClawdStrike's advantage: the **Spine protocol** creates natural SaaS monetization. Running NATS JetStream clusters, checkpoint operators, witnesses, and proofs APIs at scale is operationally complex. Organizations that adopt ClawdStrike self-hosted for development will naturally upgrade to ClawdStrike Cloud for production -- the same pattern that drove Elastic Cloud, HCP, and Sysdig Secure adoption.

### 5.4 Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Timeline | Milestone | Estimated ARR |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Month 0-6 | Open source launch, early adopters | $0 |
| Month 6-12 | Team plan beta, 50 organizations | $100K-$300K |
| Month 12-18 | Enterprise plan GA, 200 organizations | $1M-$3M |
| Month 18-24 | Enterprise traction, marketplace revenue | $5M-$10M |
| Year 3 | Growth phase, compliance demand (EU AI Act) | $20M-$40M |
| Year 5 | Category leader | $100M+ |

These projections assume the AI agent security market develops along the trajectory suggested by the 40-46% CAGR of the broader AI agent market, and that ClawdStrike captures a meaningful share of the security spend (~2-5% of the $52B agent economy's infrastructure/security budget).

### 6.2 Detailed Competitive Analysis

**vs CrowdStrike Falcon**

CrowdStrike dominates EDR with ~$3.7B ARR and the Falcon sensor on millions of endpoints. But Falcon is designed for endpoints, not AI agents. It has no concept of:
- Agent tool boundaries (MCP, function calling, prompt injection)
- Policy-gated actions with cryptographic receipts
- Community-curated security policies
- Offline-capable mesh enforcement

CrowdStrike could theoretically build agent-specific features, but their architecture is fundamentally endpoint-centric. The Falcon sensor watches processes and files; ClawdStrike watches agent actions and tool invocations. These are different security primitives requiring different architectures.

**Strategic positioning**: "CrowdStrike secures your laptops. ClawdStrike secures your AI agents."

**vs Wiz**

Wiz is the fastest-growing security company ($700M+ ARR, targeting $1B by 2026), focused on cloud security posture management (CSPM). Wiz is agentless -- it scans cloud configurations and finds misconfigurations. It has no runtime enforcement capability. No agent-level visibility. No proof infrastructure.

**Strategic positioning**: "Wiz tells you your cloud is misconfigured. ClawdStrike proves your agents operated within policy."

**vs Sysdig / Falco**

Sysdig is the closest architectural competitor. Falco (open source, Apache 2.0, CNCF graduated) provides runtime security detection using eBPF. Sysdig Secure adds commercial features on top. However:
- Falco is detection-only (alerts, not enforcement)
- No agent-specific guards
- No cryptographic proof chain
- No marketplace for community policies
- No offline mesh capability

ClawdStrike integrates with Tetragon (which provides enforcement, not just detection) and adds the attestation layer that Falco lacks.

**Strategic positioning**: "Falco detects container threats. ClawdStrike enforces AI agent policy with cryptographic proof."

**vs OPA / Gatekeeper**

OPA is the standard for Kubernetes admission control. Gatekeeper enforces OPA policies on cluster resources. But OPA is policy-only:
- No runtime detection
- No agent-level guards
- No proof infrastructure
- No eBPF integration
- Kubernetes-specific (not agent-runtime-aware)

ClawdStrike could potentially generate OPA/Rego policies from its YAML rulesets for complementary k8s enforcement.

**Strategic positioning**: "OPA gates what enters your cluster. ClawdStrike gates what your agents do inside it."

**vs Operant AI (Agent Protector)**

Operant AI launched Agent Protector in February 2026, the most direct competitor. However, Operant is:
- Proprietary (no open source core)
- No kernel-level enforcement (application layer only)
- No cryptographic proof chain
- No offline capability
- No community marketplace

**Strategic positioning**: "Operant AI is a proprietary agent firewall. ClawdStrike is an open source, kernel-enforced, cryptographically provable SDR platform."

**vs Nothing (Greenfield)**

The most honest comparison: 63% of organizations deploying AI agents have no security controls at all. ClawdStrike's primary competitor is **inertia and the absence of tooling**. The quickest path to adoption is making the open source SDK trivially easy to integrate:

```bash
# One line to add ClawdStrike to any AI agent
pip install clawdstrike
```

```python
from clawdstrike import HushEngine

engine = HushEngine.from_policy("strict")
result = engine.check(action_type="file_access", target="/etc/passwd")
if result.denied:
    raise SecurityError(result.reason)
```

### 6.3 Defensibility

ClawdStrike's competitive moat has multiple layers:

1. **Protocol moat**: The Spine protocol (SignedEnvelope + Merkle proofs + witness co-signatures) is a novel combination. Competitors cannot replicate the cross-layer attestation chain without building equivalent infrastructure.

2. **Ecosystem moat**: The policy marketplace creates network effects. More rulesets attract more users. More users attract more ruleset authors. This flywheel is hard to replicate once established.

3. **Community moat**: Open source projects with active communities are very difficult to displace. Once organizations invest in writing ClawdStrike guards and rulesets, switching costs are high.

4. **Integration moat**: Deep integration with CNCF ecosystem (Tetragon, Cilium, SPIRE, NATS) creates an infrastructure surface area that proprietary competitors cannot match.

5. **Compliance moat**: Once compliance teams standardize on ClawdStrike's audit trail format for EU AI Act / SOC2 / HIPAA reporting, changing systems requires re-certifying.

```

### 7.5 CTF / Education Strategy

**ClawdStrike CTF: "Swarm Wars"**

A series of CTF challenges designed to teach AI agent security concepts:

1. **Level 1**: Bypass a permissive policy to exfiltrate a secret (teaches: why rulesets matter)
2. **Level 2**: Prompt-inject an agent to call unauthorized MCP tools (teaches: McpToolGuard)
3. **Level 3**: Jailbreak an agent past the 4-layer detection (teaches: JailbreakGuard)
4. **Level 4**: Tamper with a guard receipt (teaches: cryptographic verification)
5. **Level 5**: Coordinate a multi-agent swarm attack (teaches: why SDR is needed)

Each challenge runs in a sandboxed environment with ClawdStrike deployed. Solutions are educational write-ups published after the event. This builds community, generates content, and positions ClawdStrike as the thought leader in AI agent security.
