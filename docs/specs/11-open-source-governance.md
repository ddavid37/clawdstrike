# Spec 11: Open Source Governance

> **Status:** Draft | **Date:** 2026-02-07
> **Author:** Phase C Spec Agent
> **Effort estimate:** 3-4 engineer-days
> **Dependencies:** Spec 04 (Apache 2.0 license migration) for license references in CONTRIBUTING.md

---

## Summary / Objective

Upgrade the project's open source governance infrastructure for a public launch: overhaul `CONTRIBUTING.md` to reflect the full SDR stack (Spine, bridges, marketplace, desktop), create a standalone `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1), expand `SECURITY.md` with private vulnerability reporting and an expanded scope covering Spine/bridges/marketplace, add GitHub issue templates (bug, feature, security policy, guard proposal), add a PR template, and create a `GOVERNANCE.md` documenting the BDFL + Maintainer Council model with a path to CNCF governance.

---

## Current State

### What exists today

**`CONTRIBUTING.md`** (220 lines):

- Covers Rust-only development (prerequisites list Rust 1.93+, optional Node/Python/wasm-pack). Node.js version should be listed as 24+ to match CI.
- Architecture diagram is outdated: missing Spine, bridges, multi-agent, certification, desktop
- References "MIT License" (line 213), which will change under Spec 04
- No DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) sign-off requirement
- No mention of security-sensitive review requirements
- No contribution guide for rulesets, guards, or adapters (the easiest on-ramps)
- Pull request review says "a maintainer will review" with no defined SLAs or areas of ownership

**`SECURITY.md`** (109 lines):

- Basic vulnerability reporting process (email connor@backbay.io)
- Response timeline: 48h ack, 7d assessment, 30d fix
- Good security model description for guards and attestation
- Missing: Spine protocol scope, marketplace supply chain scope, bridge/kernel scope
- Missing: GitHub private vulnerability reporting integration
- Missing: CVE/advisory publication process
- Missing: Security audit history and planned audits

**`LICENSE`** (22 lines):

- MIT License, Copyright 2026 Backbay Industries
- Will change to Apache 2.0 under Spec 04

**No `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**:

- CONTRIBUTING.md references the Rust Code of Conduct by link only
- A standalone file is expected by GitHub and CNCF

**No `GOVERNANCE.md`**:

- No defined governance model, decision process, or maintainer roles

**No GitHub issue templates**:

- No `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
- No issue forms (YAML-based)
- No PR template

**Existing `.github/` assets**:

- `dependabot.yml` -- dependency update automation
- `release.yml` -- GitHub Releases config
- Workflow files: `ci.yml`, `docker.yml`, `docs.yml`, `fuzz.yml`, `release.yml`
- Brand assets in `.github/assets/`

### Referenced research

From `docs/research/open-source-strategy.md` (section 4.3, Community Governance Model):

> **Phase 1 (0-12 months): BDFL with Maintainer Council**
>
> - Founding team retains final decision authority
> - Maintainer Council of 3-5 core contributors with commit access
> - All design decisions documented in RFCs (markdown in `docs/rfcs/`)
> - Weekly community call (recorded, notes published)
> - Decision process: RFC -> community comment period (2 weeks) -> BDFL approval

> **Phase 2 (12-24 months): Steering Committee**
>
> - Transition to 5-member elected Steering Committee
> - BDFL retains veto on security-critical decisions only

> **Phase 3 (24+ months): CNCF Sandbox Application**
>
> - Apache 2.0 license, CLA or DCO
> - Dual-company maintainership

From section 4.4 (Contribution Guidelines):

> - All contributions via GitHub Pull Request
> - DCO sign-off required (`Signed-off-by:` trailer)
> - CI must pass: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`
> - Security-sensitive changes require review from 2 maintainers
> - Guard and ruleset contributions require test coverage

From section 4.4 (Extension points):

1. Rulesets (YAML) -- lowest barrier
2. Guard plugins (Rust)
3. Transport adapters (Rust/Python)
4. Framework adapters (TS/Python)
5. Compliance templates
6. Bridge plugins (Rust + eBPF)

From section 9 (Phase 0 timeline):

> Create CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md (3 days)

---

## Target State

After this work is complete:

1. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** is comprehensive, covering all contribution types (rulesets, guards, adapters, bridges, Spine transports, docs, compliance templates), with DCO requirement and multi-language dev setup
2. **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** is the Contributor Covenant v2.1, standalone file
3. **`SECURITY.md`** covers the full SDR stack scope, integrates GitHub private vulnerability reporting, defines CVE publication process, and lists planned security audits
4. **`GOVERNANCE.md`** defines the BDFL + Maintainer Council model with component ownership areas, RFC process, and evolution path
5. **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`** contains issue forms for: bug report, feature request, guard proposal, security policy/ruleset proposal
6. **`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`** guides PR authors through checklist
7. All files cross-reference each other and are discoverable from the repository root

---

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

Adopt the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) verbatim, with enforcement contact filled in.

```markdown
# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone...

[Full text of Contributor Covenant v2.1]

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project team at **connor@backbay.io**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],
version 2.1, available at
https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html
```

**Rationale:** Contributor Covenant v2.1 is the CNCF standard. Using it positions the project for future CNCF Sandbox application.

### Step 2: Create `GOVERNANCE.md`

Define the governance model in phases, matching the open-source-strategy.md roadmap:

```markdown
# ClawdStrike Governance

## Current Model: BDFL + Maintainer Council

ClawdStrike uses a Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) governance model with
a Maintainer Council for the initial phase of the project.

### BDFL

The BDFL has final authority on all project decisions.

- **Current BDFL:** Connor (GitHub: @connor)

### Maintainer Council

Maintainers have commit access and review authority within their component areas.

| Maintainer | Component Area            | GitHub |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------ |
| (TBD)      | Guards / Policy Engine    |        |
| (TBD)      | Spine Protocol            |        |
| (TBD)      | Desktop / SDK             |        |
| (TBD)      | Bridges / Infrastructure  |        |
| (TBD)      | Documentation / Community |        |

### Decision Process

1. **Minor changes** (bug fixes, docs, typos): Single maintainer approval
2. **Feature additions** (new guards, adapters): Maintainer approval + CI pass
3. **Architecture changes** (new crates, protocol changes): RFC required
4. **Security-sensitive changes** (crypto, guard logic, Spine protocol): Two maintainer reviews
5. **Governance changes**: BDFL approval

### RFC Process

Significant design decisions are documented as RFCs in `docs/rfcs/`:

1. Author opens a PR adding `docs/rfcs/NNNN-title.md`
2. Community comment period: 14 days minimum
3. Maintainer Council discusses in weekly call
4. BDFL approves, requests changes, or rejects
5. Approved RFCs are merged and implementation can begin

### Component Ownership

| Component         | Directory                         | Owner(s)             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Crypto primitives | `crates/libs/hush-core/`          | Guards maintainer    |
| Guard engine      | `crates/libs/clawdstrike/`        | Guards maintainer    |
| Spine protocol    | `crates/libs/spine/`              | Spine maintainer     |
| Tetragon bridge   | `crates/bridges/tetragon-bridge/` | Bridges maintainer   |
| Hubble bridge     | `crates/bridges/hubble-bridge/`   | Bridges maintainer   |
| hushd daemon      | `crates/services/hushd/`          | Guards maintainer    |
| CLI               | `crates/services/hush-cli/`       | Guards maintainer    |
| Desktop app       | `apps/desktop/`                   | Desktop maintainer   |
| TypeScript SDK    | `packages/sdk/hush-ts/`           | Desktop maintainer   |
| Python SDK        | `packages/sdk/hush-py/`           | Community maintainer |
| Rulesets          | `rulesets/`                       | Any maintainer       |
| Documentation     | `docs/`                           | Any maintainer       |
| Helm chart        | `infra/deploy/helm/`              | Bridges maintainer   |

### Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainer candidates are nominated by existing maintainers based on:

- Sustained, high-quality contributions (6+ merged PRs)
- Demonstrated understanding of the codebase and design philosophy
- Constructive participation in reviews and discussions
- Alignment with the project's fail-closed security philosophy

The BDFL approves all maintainer additions.

## Future Evolution

### Phase 2: Steering Committee (12-24 months)

When the contributor base grows beyond the founding team:

- Transition to a 5-member elected Steering Committee
- BDFL retains veto on security-critical decisions only
- Sub-teams form around components with designated leads
- Annual elections for Steering Committee seats

### Phase 3: CNCF Sandbox (24+ months)

Requirements for CNCF Sandbox application:

- 2+ maintainers from different organizations
- Apache 2.0 license (prerequisite: Spec 04 must be completed first)
- Adopt CNCF governance template
- Security audit completed
- 3+ production adopters

```

### Step 3: Overhaul `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Major changes from the current version:

1. **Add DCO sign-off requirement** with instructions:

   ```
   git commit -s -m "feat(guards): add rate limiting"
   ```

   Every commit must include `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` (DCO 1.1).

2. **Update architecture diagram** to include Spine, bridges, marketplace, desktop, multi-agent, certification crates

3. **Add contribution on-ramps by difficulty** (from open-source-strategy.md section 4.4):
   - Level 1: Rulesets (YAML) -- with step-by-step example
   - Level 2: Documentation improvements
   - Level 3: Framework adapters (TypeScript/Python)
   - Level 4: Compliance templates
   - Level 5: Custom guards (Rust) -- with Guard trait example
   - Level 6: Transport adapters
   - Level 7: Bridge plugins

4. **Add multi-language development sections** (with prerequisite versions):
   - Rust 1.93+ (existing, update to include Spine and bridges)
   - Node.js 24+ / TypeScript (`npm install --workspace=packages/sdk/hush-ts && npm test`)
   - Python 3.10+ (`pip install -e packages/sdk/hush-py[dev] && pytest`)
   - Desktop (`cd apps/desktop && npm run tauri dev`)

5. **Add security review requirements**: "Changes to cryptographic code (`crates/libs/hush-core/`), guard implementations, or the Spine protocol require review from two maintainers."

6. **Update license reference**: Change "MIT License" to "Apache License 2.0". **This change is conditional on Spec 04 (Apache 2.0 license migration) completing first.** If Spec 04 has not yet landed, use a placeholder: `"See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for the project's license terms."` to avoid referencing an incorrect license.

7. **Add ruleset contribution guide** with example:

   ```yaml
   # rulesets/community/my-policy.yaml
   schema_version: "1.1.0"
   name: "my-org-baseline"
   extends: "default"
   guards:
     forbidden_paths:
       deny:
         - "/etc/shadow"
   ```

8. **Reference GOVERNANCE.md** for decision-making process

9. **Reference CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** directly (not the Rust CoC)

### Step 4: Expand `SECURITY.md`

Major additions:

1. **Enable GitHub private vulnerability reporting**:
   Add to `SECURITY.md`:

   ```
   ## Reporting a Vulnerability

   We use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting. To report:

   1. Go to https://github.com/backbay-labs/clawdstrike/security/advisories/new
   2. Fill out the vulnerability report form
   3. We will respond within 48 hours

   Alternatively, email connor@backbay.io with PGP-encrypted details.
   ```

   Enable in repo settings: Settings > Security > Private vulnerability reporting.

2. **Expand security scope** to cover the full SDR stack:

   | Component   | Security Scope                                                | Critical Assets                      |
   | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
   | hush-core   | Ed25519 signing, SHA-256/Keccak, Merkle trees, canonical JSON | Key material, signature verification |
   | Guards      | Policy evaluation, guard bypass resistance                    | Fail-closed invariant                |
   | Spine       | Envelope signing, checkpoint integrity, proof verification    | Append-only log, witness signatures  |
   | Bridges     | Tetragon/Hubble event integrity, NATS transport               | Signing key management, dedup        |
   | Marketplace | Feed signing, bundle verification, IPFS content integrity     | Curator keys, provenance chain       |
   | hushd       | API auth, audit log integrity, SSE broadcast                  | API keys, audit database             |
   | Desktop     | Tauri IPC, localStorage trust config, P2P discovery           | Trust settings, local key storage    |

3. **Add CVE publication process**:

   ```
   ## CVE Publication

   For confirmed vulnerabilities:
   1. We request a CVE ID via GitHub Security Advisory
   2. We develop and test a fix on a private branch
   3. We publish the fix, CVE, and advisory simultaneously
   4. Security patches are released within 48 hours for critical issues
   ```

4. **Add planned security audits section**:

   ```
   ## Security Audits

   | Scope | Status | Firm | Date |
   |-------|--------|------|------|
   | hush-core cryptography | Planned | TBD | Pre-1.0 |
   | Spine protocol | Planned | TBD | Pre-1.0 |
   | Guard bypass resistance | Planned | TBD | Pre-1.0 |
   ```

5. **Add security design principles**:
   - Fail-closed: Invalid policies reject at load time; errors during evaluation deny access
   - No `unwrap()`/`expect()` in production code (Clippy enforced)
   - `deny_unknown_fields` on all deserialized types
   - Canonical JSON (RFC 8785) for cross-language determinism

### Step 5: Create GitHub issue templates

**`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`:**

```yaml
blank_issues_enabled: false
contact_links:
  - name: Security Vulnerability
    url: https://github.com/backbay-labs/clawdstrike/security/advisories/new

## Testing Strategy

### Validation (no automated tests -- these are documentation files)

1. **Render check**: All markdown files render correctly on GitHub (no broken links, tables, or formatting)
2. **Link validation**: Run a markdown link checker (`mlc` or `markdown-link-check`) against all governance files
3. **Issue template test**: Create a test issue using each template in a draft/fork to verify form rendering
4. **PR template test**: Open a test PR to verify the template appears
5. **DCO enforcement**: Set up a GitHub App or CI check (e.g., `dco-check` GitHub Action) that verifies `Signed-off-by:` on all commits in PRs
6. **Cross-reference audit**: Verify every governance file links to the others correctly

### CI addition (optional but recommended)

Add a DCO check to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
dco:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    - uses: cla-assistant/github-action@v2
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        check-dco: true
```

Alternatively, use the simpler `probot/dco` GitHub App.

---

## Rollback Plan

1. **Revert commits**: All changes are documentation files. A simple `git revert` restores the previous versions.
2. **Issue templates**: Delete `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory to restore default GitHub issue creation.
3. **PR template**: Delete `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to remove the PR checklist.
4. **DCO check**: Disable the CI job or GitHub App.
5. **No data loss**: These are all additive documentation files with no impact on runtime behavior.
