# Clawdstrike Agent Framework Integrations

## Executive Summary

Clawdstrike is a security SDK designed to enforce runtime security policies for AI agents. As AI agents increasingly operate autonomously with access to filesystems, networks, and code execution capabilities, the need for robust, framework-agnostic security enforcement becomes critical.

This document outlines the strategy for integrating Clawdstrike's policy engine with popular AI agent frameworks, enabling developers to secure their agents regardless of the underlying orchestration technology.

## Version Compatibility

| Component | Minimum Version | Tested Up To |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **@backbay/openclaw** | 0.1.0 | 0.x |
| **Node.js** | 18.0.0 | 22.x |
| **TypeScript** | 5.0.0 | 5.x |

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Modern AI agent frameworks provide powerful abstractions for tool use, multi-agent coordination, and autonomous task execution. However, they lack standardized security primitives:

1. **No Unified Security Model**: Each framework implements tools differently, making it difficult to apply consistent security policies across projects.

2. **Tool Call Opacity**: Agent frameworks often treat tool calls as black boxes, providing limited hooks for inspection, modification, or cancellation before execution.

3. **Post-Hoc Enforcement Limitations**: Existing security tools primarily operate at the infrastructure level (firewalls, sandboxes) rather than at the semantic level where AI decisions happen.

4. **Secret Exposure Risk**: Agents handling credentials, API keys, and sensitive data may inadvertently expose them through tool outputs or logging.

5. **Prompt Injection Attacks**: Malicious content in fetched web pages, documents, or user inputs can hijack agent behavior.

### The Opportunity

By intercepting tool calls at the framework level, Clawdstrike can:

- **Preflight Check**: Evaluate proposed actions against policy before execution
- **Block Violations**: Cancel dangerous operations before they occur
- **Redact Secrets**: Scrub sensitive data from tool outputs
- **Audit Trail**: Log all security-relevant decisions for compliance
- **Adaptive Enforcement**: Apply different policies per environment, user, or task

## Integration Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Framework-Native Integration**: Leverage each framework's extension mechanisms (callbacks, middleware, hooks) rather than monkey-patching or wrapping.

2. **Minimal Performance Overhead**: Policy evaluation should add negligible latency to tool execution paths.

3. **Graceful Degradation**: Security enforcement should fail safely, defaulting to deny in ambiguous situations.

4. **Configuration Portability**: Security policies should be defined once and work across all integrated frameworks.

5. **Developer Experience**: Integration should require minimal code changes and provide clear error messages.

### Security Model

```
+-------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
|   Agent Framework |     |   Clawdstrike    |     |   Tool Execution |
|                   |     |   Middleware     |     |                  |
|  [Tool Request] --+---->| [Policy Check] --+---->| [Execute Tool]   |
|                   |     |                  |     |                  |
|  [Tool Result] <--+-----| [Output Guard] <-+-----| [Return Result]  |
+-------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
         |                        |
         |                        v
         |                +------------------+
         |                |   Audit Store    |
         +--------------->|   (Events Log)   |
                          +------------------+
```

### Interception Points

Every framework integration targets these interception points:

| Point | Phase | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Pre-Call** | Before tool execution | Policy evaluation, parameter validation |
| **Post-Call** | After tool execution | Output sanitization, secret redaction |
| **Bootstrap** | Agent initialization | Security prompt injection, policy loading |
| **Error** | On failure | Graceful error handling, violation logging |

## Target Frameworks

| Framework | Popularity | Integration Complexity | Priority |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|----------|
| **LangChain/LangGraph** | Very High | Medium | P0 |
| **CrewAI** | High | Low | P1 |
| **AutoGPT/AgentGPT** | High | High | P1 |
| **Vercel AI SDK** | High | Low | P0 |
| **Microsoft AutoGen** | Medium | Medium | P2 |
| **Custom/Generic** | N/A | Varies | P0 |

## Architecture Overview

### Clawdstrike Core Components

```typescript
// Policy Engine - Evaluates events against security policy
interface PolicyEngine {
  evaluate(event: PolicyEvent): Promise<Decision>;
  redactSecrets(content: string): string;
  getPolicy(): Policy;
  lintPolicy(ref: string): Promise<PolicyLintResult>;
}

// Decision - Result of policy evaluation
interface Decision {
  allowed: boolean;
  denied: boolean;
  warn: boolean;
  reason?: string;
  message?: string;  // Alias for reason, used in warning contexts
  guard?: string;
  severity?: Severity;
}

// Policy Event - Action to be evaluated
interface PolicyEvent {
  eventId: string;
  eventType: EventType;
  timestamp: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  data: EventData;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

// Event Types
type EventType =
  | 'file_read'
  | 'file_write'
  | 'command_exec'
  | 'network_egress'
  | 'tool_call'
  | 'patch_apply'
  | 'secret_access';
```

### Guards System

Clawdstrike employs a modular guard system where each guard handles specific security concerns:

| Guard | Purpose | Events Handled |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `ForbiddenPathGuard` | Block access to sensitive paths | file_read, file_write |
| `EgressGuard` | Control network access | network_egress |
| `SecretLeakGuard` | Detect/redact secrets | tool_call, patch_apply |
| `PatchIntegrityGuard` | Validate code patches | patch_apply, command_exec |
| `McpToolGuard` | Restrict tool usage | tool_call |

### Policy Configuration

```yaml
# clawdstrike-policy.yaml

## Conclusion

Clawdstrike's agent framework integrations provide a unified security layer for AI agents across the ecosystem. By meeting developers where they are (their chosen framework) and providing consistent, policy-driven enforcement, we can significantly reduce the security risks inherent in autonomous AI systems.

The modular architecture ensures that as new frameworks emerge or existing ones evolve, Clawdstrike can adapt without requiring fundamental changes to its security model.
