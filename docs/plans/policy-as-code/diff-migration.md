# Policy Diff and Migration Tooling for Clawdstrike

## Problem Statement

Policy changes in production environments are inherently risky. Without proper tooling:

### Current Challenges

1. **Blind Deployments**: No visibility into what actually changes between policy versions
2. **Breaking Changes**: Policy updates may inadvertently tighten rules, breaking workflows
3. **Rollback Complexity**: No easy way to revert to a previous policy state
4. **Schema Migrations**: Upgrading policy schema versions requires manual intervention
5. **Audit Requirements**: Compliance requires documenting all policy changes

### Real-World Scenarios

| Scenario | Risk | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| Add new forbidden path pattern | May block legitimate access | Developer productivity loss |
| Remove egress domain | API integrations silently fail | Service outages |
| Change severity level | Alerts may be missed | Security gaps |
| Upgrade schema version | Incompatible syntax | Policy fails to load |

# Policy Change Report

**Generated:** 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
**Old Policy:** old.yaml (v1.0.0)
**New Policy:** new.yaml (v1.1.0)

## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Additions | 3 |
| Removals | 1 |
| Modifications | 2 |
| Breaking Changes | 1 |

## Changes

### Guards

#### forbidden_path

**Patterns Added:**
- `**/secrets/**` - Block secrets directory
- `**/credentials/**` - Block credentials directory

**Patterns Removed:**
- `**/.vault/**` - No longer blocking vault

#### egress_allowlist

**Modified:**
- `*.github.com` -> `api.github.com` (more restrictive)
- `default_action`: `allow` -> `block` **BREAKING**

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Egress Default Action

**Change:** `egress_allowlist.default_action` changed from `allow` to `block`

**Impact:** All network requests not explicitly allowed will be blocked.

**Affected Events:** `network_egress`

**Mitigation:**
1. Review all egress destinations in your application
2. Add required domains to `egress_allowlist.allow`
3. Test with `clawdstrike policy simulate` before deploying

## Recommendations

1. Run impact analysis: `clawdstrike policy impact old.yaml new.yaml --replay audit.json`
2. Update tests to cover new patterns
3. Notify teams of egress behavior change
```

### What Constitutes a Breaking Change

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  Breaking Change Classification                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                   |
|  ALWAYS BREAKING:                                                 |
|  +------------------------------------------------------------+  |
|  | - Adding forbidden path patterns (blocks more paths)        |  |
|  | - Removing egress allow domains (blocks more egress)        |  |
|  | - Changing default_action from 'allow' to 'block'          |  |
|  | - Lowering numeric limits (max_additions, timeout, etc.)   |  |
|  | - Raising severity levels (warn -> deny)                    |  |
|  | - Adding to tool deny list                                  |  |

|  +------------------------------------------------------------+  |
|  | - Modifying regex patterns (may match more or less)         |  |
|  | - Changing glob patterns (wildcards are tricky)             |  |
|  | - Updating extends reference (inherits different base)      |  |
|  | - Modifying merge_strategy                                  |  |

|  NOT BREAKING:                                                    |
|  +------------------------------------------------------------+  |
|  | - Removing forbidden path patterns (allows more)            |  |
|  | - Adding egress allow domains (allows more)                 |  |
|  | - Changing default_action from 'block' to 'allow'          |  |

## Impact Analysis

### Replay-Based Analysis

```bash
# Analyze what would change with new policy
clawdstrike policy impact old.yaml new.yaml --replay audit.json
```

Output:

```
Impact Analysis Report
======================

Audit Period: 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-15
Events Analyzed: 10,847

Decision Changes:
  - Total changed: 156 (1.4%)
  - Newly denied: 89
  - Newly allowed: 12
  - Severity changed: 55

Newly Denied Events (Top 10):
  1. network_egress to cdn.example.com (45 occurrences)
     Change: default_action now 'block'
     Mitigation: Add cdn.example.com to egress_allowlist.allow

  2. file_read /app/secrets/config.yaml (23 occurrences)
     Change: New pattern **/secrets/**
     Mitigation: Review if these accesses are legitimate

  3. tool_call: shell_exec (21 occurrences)
     Change: Added to mcp_tool.block
     Mitigation: Use safer alternatives or add exception

Recommendation:
  Before deploying, address the 89 newly denied events
  Run: clawdstrike policy simulate new.yaml --events audit.json
```

## Programmatic API

### TypeScript API

```typescript
import {
  PolicyDiff,
  PolicyMigrator,
  BreakingChangeDetector,
  ImpactAnalyzer
} from '@backbay/openclaw';

// Diff two policies
const oldPolicy = await loadPolicy('old.yaml');
const newPolicy = await loadPolicy('new.yaml');

const diff = PolicyDiff.compare(oldPolicy, newPolicy);

console.log(`Changes: ${diff.changes.length}`);
console.log(`Breaking: ${diff.breakingChanges.length}`);

for (const change of diff.changes) {
  console.log(`${change.type}: ${change.path}`);
  if (change.breaking) {
    console.log(`  BREAKING: ${change.impact}`);
  }
}

// Detect breaking changes
const detector = new BreakingChangeDetector();
const breaking = detector.detect(oldPolicy, newPolicy);

if (breaking.length > 0) {
  throw new Error(`${breaking.length} breaking changes detected`);
}

// Impact analysis with audit log
const analyzer = new ImpactAnalyzer();
const impact = await analyzer.analyze({
  oldPolicy,
  newPolicy,
  auditLog: 'audit.json'
});

console.log(`Events affected: ${impact.changedDecisions.length}`);
console.log(`New denials: ${impact.newDenials.length}`);

// Migrate policy
const migrator = new PolicyMigrator();
const migrated = await migrator.migrate(oldPolicy, {
  targetVersion: '2.0.0',
  dryRun: false
});

await writePolicy('policy.yaml', migrated);
```

### Rust API

```rust
use clawdstrike::diff::{PolicyDiff, DiffOptions, BreakingChangeLevel};
use clawdstrike::migrate::{Migrator, MigrationOptions};

// Diff policies
let old_policy = Policy::from_yaml_file("old.yaml")?;
let new_policy = Policy::from_yaml_file("new.yaml")?;

let diff = PolicyDiff::compare(&old_policy, &new_policy, DiffOptions::default());

for change in &diff.changes {
    println!("{}: {} -> {}", change.path, change.old_value, change.new_value);
}

// Check for breaking changes
let breaking = diff.breaking_changes();
if !breaking.is_empty() {
    for bc in breaking {
        eprintln!("BREAKING: {} - {}", bc.path, bc.description);
    }
    return Err(Error::BreakingChanges(breaking));
}

// Migrate policy
let migrator = Migrator::new()?;
let options = MigrationOptions {
    target_version: "2.0.0".to_string(),
    dry_run: true,
    backup: true,
};

let result = migrator.migrate(&old_policy, options)?;

if result.dry_run {
    println!("Migration preview:");
    for step in &result.steps {
        println!("  {}: {}", step.operation, step.description);
    }
} else {
    result.migrated_policy.to_yaml_file("policy.yaml")?;

## Appendix: Diff Algorithm

### Structural Diff Algorithm

```
1. Parse both policies into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
2. Normalize paths (resolve extends, apply merge strategy)
3. Walk both ASTs in parallel:
   a. For each node in old policy:
      - If present in new: mark as "unchanged" or "modified"
      - If absent in new: mark as "removed"
   b. For each node in new policy:
      - If absent in old: mark as "added"
4. For modified nodes:
   a. Compare values
   b. Determine change type (value change, type change, etc.)
5. Apply breaking change rules to each change
6. Generate output
```

### Semantic Diff for Patterns

```
For pattern lists (glob, regex):
1. Compare set membership
2. Analyze pattern overlap:
   - Does new pattern subsume old?
   - Does old pattern subsume new?
3. Detect broadening vs narrowing:
   - "*.github.com" -> "api.github.com" = narrowing
   - "api.github.com" -> "*.github.com" = broadening
4. Flag as breaking if narrowing in allow-list or broadening in deny-list
```
