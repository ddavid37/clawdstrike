## Current State

Clawdstrike is a fail-closed policy engine and cryptographic attestation runtime for autonomous AI agents. It sits at the tool boundary — the point where an agent's intent becomes a real-world action — and enforces security policy with signed proof. Here is what ships today.

### Core Engine (Rust)

| Component | Crate | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Cryptographic primitives (Ed25519, SHA-256, Keccak-256, Merkle trees, RFC 8785 canonical JSON) | `hush-core` | Stable |
| Policy engine, guard pipeline, receipt signing | `clawdstrike` | Stable (v0.1.3) |
| Signed envelopes, checkpoints, NATS transport, Merkle proofs | `spine` | Stable |
| CLI binary (`clawdstrike`, `hush` commands) | `hush-cli` | Stable |
| Spine protocol CLI tools | `spine-cli` | Stable |

## Vision

Clawdstrike evolves from a standalone policy engine into an **ecosystem platform** — a place where the security community builds, shares, and composes guards, policies, and compliance packs for AI agent security. The trajectory:

```text
Standalone Engine ──> Package Manager ──> Registry ──> Ecosystem Platform
     (today)         (local packages)    (shared)      (community + enterprise)
```

**Core thesis:** The guard stack should be as extensible as a package registry. Security teams should install a HIPAA compliance pack the same way they install an npm package. Community researchers should publish novel detection guards and have them deployed across thousands of agent fleets within hours, not months.

**Non-negotiable invariants as the platform scales:**
1. **Fail closed.** Every new abstraction layer defaults to deny.
2. **Proof, not logs.** Community guards produce the same Ed25519 receipts as built-in guards.
3. **Same envelope, any pipe.** Package metadata and guard decisions travel over the same Spine protocol.
4. **Attenuation only.** Third-party guards receive capability subsets, never escalate.
5. **Own your stack.** Apache-2.0. Self-hostable. No vendor lock-in.

---

## Package Manager Roadmap

The package manager is the highest-priority initiative. It transforms Clawdstrike from a closed set of 12 built-in guards into an open ecosystem where anyone can publish guards, policies, and compliance packs.

### Phase 0: Local Packages (4-6 weeks)

**Goal:** Users can package guards and policies into `.cpkg` archives and install them locally. The engine loads them at startup.

```text
Developer writes guard
        |
        v
  clawdstrike-pkg.toml    <-- manifest
        |
        v
  clawdstrike pkg pack     <-- produces .cpkg archive
        |
        v
  ~/.clawdstrike/packages/ <-- local package store
        |
        v
  Engine discovers & loads  <-- CustomGuardRegistry + PolicyResolver
```

**Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `clawdstrike-pkg.toml` manifest spec | Package metadata: name, version, authors, guard entry points, policy files, dependencies, capability requirements |
| `.cpkg` archive format | Deterministic tar+zstd archive with embedded SHA-256 content hashes |
| `clawdstrike pkg pack` | CLI command to produce `.cpkg` from a project directory |
| `clawdstrike pkg install <path>` | Install a `.cpkg` into the local package store |
| `clawdstrike pkg list` | List installed packages with versions and capabilities |
| `CustomGuardRegistry` loader | Discovers and loads guard implementations from installed packages |
| `PolicyResolver` extension | Resolves `extends: pkg:<name>/<policy>` references to installed package policies |

**Manifest example:**

```toml
[package]
name = "hipaa-guards"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "HIPAA compliance guards for healthcare AI agents"
authors = ["Security Team <security@example.com>"]
license = "Apache-2.0"

[guards]
phi-access = { entry = "src/phi_access.wasm", capabilities = ["fs:read"] }
phi-egress = { entry = "src/phi_egress.wasm", capabilities = ["net:check"] }

[policies]
hipaa-strict = "policies/hipaa-strict.yaml"
hipaa-default = "policies/hipaa-default.yaml"

[dependencies]
clawdstrike-guard-sdk = "0.1"
```

**Exit criteria:** A user can build a custom guard package, install it locally, and reference its policies via `extends: pkg:hipaa-guards/hipaa-strict` in their policy YAML.

---

### Phase 1: WASM Guard Runtime (4-6 weeks)

**Goal:** Third-party guards execute in sandboxed WebAssembly with declared capabilities and resource limits. No native code execution from community packages.

```text
.cpkg contains .wasm guard
        |
        v
  WasmGuardFactory validates capabilities
        |
        v
  wasmtime sandbox with:
    - memory limit (configurable, default 16 MB)
    - fuel metering (CPU budget)
    - capability-gated host imports
        |
        v
  WasmGuard implements Guard trait
        |
        v
  Same verdict/receipt pipeline as built-in guards
```

**Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Guest ABI specification | Stable ABI contract between host and WASM guest: `check(action) -> verdict` |
| `clawdstrike-guard-sdk` crate | Rust SDK for writing guards that compile to WASM. Provides `#[clawdstrike_guard]` proc macro |
| `WasmGuard` / `WasmGuardFactory` | Host-side runtime that loads `.wasm` modules, enforces capabilities, and translates verdicts |
| Capability model | Declared capabilities (`fs:read`, `net:check`, `env:read`) validated at install time, enforced at runtime |
| Resource limits | Per-guard memory ceiling, fuel metering, wall-clock timeout |
| Guard SDK templates | `cargo generate` templates for common guard patterns (path-based, regex-based, ML-based) |
| Guard testing harness | `clawdstrike pkg test` runs guard against fixture actions, validates verdicts and receipt generation |

**Capability model:**

```text
+------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Capability       | Host Import Granted                       |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| fs:read          | read_file(path) -> bytes                  |
| fs:metadata      | file_metadata(path) -> stat               |
| net:check        | check_dns(domain) -> resolved             |
| env:read         | read_env(key) -> value                    |
| crypto:verify    | verify_signature(key, data, sig) -> bool  |
| (none declared)  | Only action context + verdict response    |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------+
```

**Exit criteria:** A community developer can write a guard in Rust, compile to WASM, package it, and have it execute in the sandboxed runtime with the same receipt guarantees as a built-in guard.

---

### Phase 2: Registry MVP (6-8 weeks)

**Goal:** A public package registry where authors publish guards and policies, and users install them with dependency resolution.

```text
Author                          Registry                        User
  |                                |                              |
  |  clawdstrike pkg publish       |                              |
  |------------------------------->|                              |
  |  .cpkg + signature + metadata  |                              |
  |                                |  sparse index update         |
  |                                |                              |
  |                                |   clawdstrike pkg install    |
  |                                |<-----------------------------|
  |                                |  resolve deps (pubgrub)      |
  |                                |  download .cpkg from registry blob storage |
  |                                |  verify signatures           |
  |                                |----------------------------->|
  |                                |  write lockfile              |
```

**Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Sparse index | HTTP sparse index endpoint (`GET /api/v1/index/{name}`) with ETag revalidation |
| Storage backend | **Current (2026-02-28):** filesystem blob store + SQLite metadata. **Planned:** OCI-backed artifact storage for hosted deployments |
| Axum API service | `POST /api/v1/packages`, `GET /api/v1/packages/{name}`, `GET /api/v1/packages/{name}/{version}`, `GET /api/v1/search` |
| `clawdstrike pkg publish` | Upload `.cpkg` with Ed25519 signature to the registry |
| `clawdstrike pkg install <name>` | Resolve dependencies, download, verify, install |
| `clawdstrike pkg search <query>` | Full-text search across package names, descriptions, tags |
| pubgrub dependency resolution | SAT-based version resolution with clear error messages on conflicts |
| `clawdstrike-pkg.lock` | Deterministic lockfile pinning exact versions and content hashes |
| Namespace reservation | Package names are globally unique; org-scoped names (`@org/package`) for verified organizations |

**Exit criteria:** An author can publish a guard package to the registry, and a user on a different machine can install it by name, with all dependencies resolved and signatures verified.

---

### Phase 3: Trust & Transparency (4-6 weeks)

**Goal:** Cryptographic trust chain from author to deployment. Every package is signed, counter-signed by the registry, and recorded in a transparency log.

```text
Author signs package
        |
        v
  Registry counter-signs (Spine envelope)
        |
        v
  Merkle transparency log (append-only)
        |
        v
  Client verifies: author sig + registry sig + inclusion proof
```

**Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Ed25519 author signing | Authors sign packages with their Ed25519 keypair. Key management via `clawdstrike pkg keygen` |
| Spine counter-signatures | Registry wraps each publish event in a Spine envelope, adding its own signature |
| Merkle transparency log | RFC 6962-style append-only log. Every publish is a leaf. Clients verify inclusion proofs |
| Trust levels | `unverified` (no signature) -> `signed` (publisher Ed25519) -> `verified` (publisher + registry counter-sig + pinned registry public key trust anchor) -> `certified` (all above + cryptographically verified checkpoint signature + transparency inclusion proof) |
| OIDC trusted publishing | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other OIDC providers can publish without long-lived keys |
| Key rotation ceremony | Documented procedure for rotating registry signing keys with overlapping validity windows |
| Audit monitor | Independent service that watches the transparency log and alerts on anomalies |

**Trust level enforcement:**

```text
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Level      | Requirements                                |
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
| unverified | No valid signature. Install requires --allow-unverified flag |
| signed     | Valid publisher Ed25519 signature            |
| verified   | Publisher sig + registry counter-signature + pinned registry public key |
| certified  | All above + checkpoint-signature verification + inclusion-proof verification |
+------------+---------------------------------------------+
```

**Exit criteria:** A user installing a package sees the trust level, can verify the author signature, and can independently check the transparency log for the package's inclusion proof.

---

### Phase 4: Ecosystem (Ongoing)

**Goal:** A thriving ecosystem of community-contributed guards, policy packs, and compliance templates.

## Research & Experimental

These capabilities are under active development. APIs are unstable and may change significantly.

### hushd HTTP Daemon

**Status:** Experimental
**Crate:** `crates/services/hushd`

Centralized enforcement server for environments where embedding the engine in every process is impractical. Agents send check requests over HTTP; hushd evaluates the policy and returns signed verdicts.

| Milestone | Description | Target |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Multi-policy routing | Route requests to different policies based on agent identity, team, or project scope | Q2 2026 |
| Policy hot-reload | Watch filesystem or NATS KV for policy changes, reload without restart | Q2 2026 |
| High-availability mode | Active-active clustering with shared state via NATS JetStream | Q3 2026 |
| gRPC API | Alternative to HTTP for high-throughput internal service meshes | Q3 2026 |

### EAS On-Chain Anchoring

**Status:** Experimental
**Crate:** `crates/services/eas-anchor`
**Spec:** [docs/specs/13-eas-onchain-anchoring.md](../specs/13-eas-onchain-anchoring.md)

Anchor Spine Merkle roots to Ethereum Attestation Service on Base L2, creating an immutable public timeline of attestation checkpoints.

| Milestone | Description | Target |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Batch anchoring | Aggregate N checkpoint roots into a single on-chain transaction to amortize gas costs | Q3 2026 |
| Verification client | `clawdstrike verify --on-chain <receipt-hash>` checks inclusion against the on-chain Merkle root | Q3 2026 |
| Cross-chain support | Anchor to additional L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism) for redundancy | Q4 2026 |

### Tetragon & Hubble Bridges

**Status:** Experimental
**Crates:** `tetragon-bridge`, `hubble-bridge`

Bridges that ingest kernel-level (Tetragon eBPF) and network-level (Cilium Hubble) events into the Spine protocol, enabling L1/L2 enforcement correlation with L3 agent-level decisions.

| Milestone | Description | Target |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Event correlation engine | Correlate Tetragon process events with Clawdstrike guard decisions by PID and timestamp | Q3 2026 |
| Hubble flow-to-egress mapping | Map Cilium flow observations to EgressAllowlistGuard decisions for L2+L3 enforcement proof | Q3 2026 |
| Combined attestation | Single Spine envelope carrying process ancestry + network policy + guard verdict + Merkle proof | Q4 2026 |

### Spider-Sense Integration

**Status:** Beta (feature-gated)
**Paper:** [Yu et al. 2026 — Spider-Sense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05386)

Hierarchical threat screening adapted as a tool-boundary guard. Fast-path cosine similarity for known patterns; optional LLM escalation for ambiguous inputs.

| Milestone | Description | Target |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Plan-stage defense | Extend screening to the plan stage (currently the "dominant blind spot" per the paper) | Q2 2026 |
| Custom pattern databases | Users supply domain-specific attack pattern databases per deployment | Q2 2026 |
| S2Bench integration tests | Full test coverage against the paper's taxonomy (4 lifecycle stages x 9 attack types) | Q2 2026 |
| Graduate from feature gate | Move from `--features clawdstrike-spider-sense` to default-on with opt-out | Q3 2026 |

### Adaptive Security Decision Runtime (SDR)

**Status:** Shipped
**Spec:** [docs/specs/15-adaptive-sdr-architecture.md](../specs/15-adaptive-sdr-architecture.md)

Automatic mode transition between standalone, connected, and degraded enforcement modes. Agents are never unprotected regardless of network conditions.

| Milestone | Description | Target |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Offline receipt queue compaction | Compact queued receipts during extended offline periods to bound storage | Q2 2026 |
| Predictive mode switching | Use network quality metrics to proactively switch modes before failure | Q3 2026 |
| Multi-remote failover | Support multiple remote engine endpoints with automatic failover | Q3 2026 |

### Priority Stack Rank

When resources are constrained, work is prioritized top-to-bottom:

| Priority | Initiative | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| P0 | Package Manager Phase 0-1 (local + WASM) | Unblocks the entire ecosystem play |
| P0 | hushd multi-policy routing + hot-reload | Required for enterprise cloud API |
| P1 | Package Manager Phase 2 (registry MVP) | Enables community contribution |
| P1 | Python v0.3.0 async + CrewAI/AutoGen adapters | Captures the fastest-growing agent framework markets |
| P1 | HIPAA/PCI/SOC2 compliance packs | Direct enterprise revenue driver |
| P2 | Package Manager Phase 3 (trust) | Builds confidence for production adoption of community guards |
| P2 | Self-hosted registry + air-gapped mode | Enterprise deal requirement |
| P2 | Spider-Sense graduation | Novel detection capability differentiator |
| P3 | EAS on-chain anchoring | Unique value prop but narrow buyer segment |
| P3 | Tetragon/Hubble correlation | Deep-stack differentiator, long implementation horizon |
| P3 | Multi-language guard SDKs (TS, Python, Go WASM) | Ecosystem growth, but Rust-first is sufficient initially |

## How to Contribute

The roadmap is open. If you want to work on any of these initiatives:

1. Check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/backbay-labs/clawdstrike/issues) for existing tracking issues tagged with `roadmap`
2. Comment on the relevant issue to signal interest
3. For new guard contributions, start with the [Custom Guards guide](guides/custom-guards.md)
4. For policy pack contributions, see the [Certification Program overview](../plans/certification/overview.md)
5. Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/clawdstrike) `#contributors` channel

**Every contribution that touches the guard pipeline must include:**
- Tests (unit + integration against fixture actions)
- Receipt generation (guards must produce verifiable receipts)
- Policy schema documentation (if adding new guard config fields)
- Clippy clean: `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
